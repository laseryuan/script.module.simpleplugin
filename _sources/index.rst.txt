Welcome to SimplePlugin documentation!
======================================

SimplePlugin micro-framework simplifies creating content plugins for `Kodi mediacenter`_.
It was inspired by `xbmcswift2 micro-framework`_ for the same purpose
and has some similar features, but overall SimplePlugin API is different from xbmcswift2.

.. warning:: SimplePlugin v.3.x has simplified API is not compatible
  with previous versions. That is why it uses a different addon ID:
  ``script.module.simpleplugin3``.
