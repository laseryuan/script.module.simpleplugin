Persistent And In-Memory Storage
================================

SimplePlugin provides :class:`Storage <simpleplugin.Storage>` and
:class:`MemStorage <simpleplugin.MemStorage>` classes with :class:`dict`-like interface
to store arbitrary data between plugin calls.
A Storage/MemStorage instance supports most of Python :class:`dict` methods
and can hold any Python picklable objects.

The :class:`Storage <simpleplugin.Storage>` class stores data on disk.
It also can be used as a context manager along with
:keyword:`with` statement. To create a Storage instance for the current plugin you need to call
:meth:`get_storage<simpleplugin.Addon.get_storage>` method for your Plugin instance, e.g.::

  with plugin.get_storage() as storage:  # Create a storage object
      storage['key1'] = value1  # Store data
      value2 = storage['key2']  # Retrieve data

After exiting a :keyword:`with` block a Storage object is invalidated.
To use the storage again you need to create a new Storage instance.
Storage contents are saved to disk only for a newly created storage or if the storage contents
have been changed. This reduces the number of write operations in cases when we need only to read stored data.

:meth:`get_storage<simpleplugin.Addon.get_storage>` method takes an optional parameter
which is the name of a storage file, so you can have several different storages in your plugin.
Storage files are stored in the plugin's profile folder which is
:file:`special://profile/addon_data/{your.plugin.id}`.

The :class:`MemStorage <simpleplugin.MemStorage>` class stores data in memory.
The storage contents last as long as Kodi runs. MemStorage is thread-safe
and can be used for communication between different Python
processes. That is, MemStorage instances with the same IDs created in different
processes share the same contents.

.. warning:: MemStorage does not allow to modify mutable objects in-place.
  You need to assign them to variables first, modify and then store them back
  to a MemStorage instance.

Example::

  storage = MemStorage('foo')
  some_list = storage['bar']
  some_list.append('spam')
  storage['bar'] = some_list
